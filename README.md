# Tic Tac Toe
A simple, straightforward Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java, undertaken as a brief, initial step towards re-familiarizing myself with the language.

## How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. You can choose to play against a (basic) bot, or another human. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
